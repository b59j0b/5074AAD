Assignment Task 
Design two   publications 一 one   printed,   one website 一 that   explore   the   narrative   possibilities of each   medium.
This   module encourages you to think about   publishing, and   how   graphic   design tools,   technologies, and   mediums can   be   used   in   different ways to create   narratives and   make   information‘public’.
Drawing   inspiration from a   unique community you already   belong to,   you   will   produce   content   material   for and design two   'publications’:
1)       A   printed   publication that celebrates and validates the   community   you   belong   to,   and;
2)       A website that informs and invites engagement from a   new   audience.
You are asked to think carefully about who the   audience   /   user   is   for   each   element,   and   how   they   interact with this‘publication’,   using these   insights to   inform. your   design choices.
(1) Printed publication 
16pp*   + cover
Your printed   publication should   be designed for other   members of the community you   are   part   of,   bringing together a collection of text and   imagery. Throughout   the   module,   you   will   be asked to   experiment with the   unique aspects /   properties of   printed   media,   deliberately   using   these aspects to enhance the user’s   (reader) experience.   You   should   use   research   to   inform   the format, design, and visual   language of your printed   publication,   considering   aspects   like: 
•               Page size and format
•               Paper stock(s)
•             Colour /   black   and   white   print /   printing   method
•             Typographic   detail
•             Image   treatment   and   graphic   elements
•             Sequencing   of text   and   image
•               Binding   method
•             Additional elements such as   paper   mechanics and folds,   tipped   in   elements,   etc.
* Or equivalent. Please negotiate any formats that do not use a clear page structure with your module leader to ensure your printed publication meets the requirements of the brief.
(2) Website 
8‘viewports’
Using   Figma, you will design a website that   reuses some or   all   of your content   from   the previous task, aiming to   inform. and engage a   new   audience   who   are   unfamiliar with   your community. Your website should clearly   be   linked to your   printed   publication (for example,   this   may   be through colour, type, etc.).   However, throughout the   module you   will   be   asked   to   think   about what   properties a website   has that   are   unique to the   medium and   different   to   printed media, and   bring these   into your design   (this   might   be things   like   using   multimedia content,   links to other pages,   pop-ups and   layers, or   playing with   animated /   scrolling   elements.)
Design Process Document (DPD) 
and Design Process Presentation (DPP) 
Assessment on this   module   measures   both your design and the   process   behind   it.   Fulfilment of this module’s   unique   learning outcomes   is therefore   checked against final outcomes   and the   research   and   development journey that led to their completion.   Evidence of process   is essential   to   your   success   on      this   module and   is demonstrated through: 
The Design Process Document (DPD): a digital log of your module   learning   journey structured   in   chronological order and capturing all   research and   its analysis,   sketching,   experimentation, development, class   notes and their   practical   application, feedback   notes and self-reflection   that   you   undertook to answer the   module   assignment   brief. 
•             Set up a   DPD   on   OneDrive for each   of your   modules   and   share   each with   the   relevant   module   leader.
•             Your tutors will   refer to your DPD   in class to   provide   you   with   useful   formative   feedback.
•             Your DPD should be   updated weekly   as   it   serves   as   foundation for your final   summary presentation   (DPP).
•             Ensure you establish   ownership   of   original   graphic   elements   by   thoroughly   evidencing their
development from sketch to   intermediary work   in   progress stages and through to final   outcome. Designs   missing evidence of development and   lacking attribution will   be   investigated for   potential   plagiarism.
DPD specifications: 
•             Working   Format   (not to   be submitted): a   PowerPoint   document   on your   personal   Microsoft

Assignment Context 
This   module asks you to   explore the   act of‘making   public’across   multiple   platforms,   using   a community you   have an existing   knowledge of and   relationship to as   your   subject   matter.   Within   this module, we will explore areas of practice   like   publication   and editorial   design,   typographic   design,   and   how   UX/UI considerations work across   both   print and digital spaces.   This   module   draws   on your   own unique   research and   perspectives, and therefore will also   provide   opportunities to   learn   about   self-publishing and design 代 写5074AAD Design NarrativeC/C++
代做程序编程语言authorship   (aka‘Designer as Author’.)
A   key element   of this   module   is exploring   both   printed and digital   publication,   how each   medium   has   unique   properties,   and   how you   might deliberately   utilise these   properties to encourage your   user or reader to engage with a   narrative   in specific ways. As designers, we   regularly   undertake projects   that      require   us to work across   platforms – using different techniques   and   channels   to   engage with   different   audiences.   Not only   is this a   key   consideration within   UX and   UI   design,   but thinking   about   how   we publish across these spaces with consistency   is a key   skill   for   designers working within   branding   and   identity.

Marking and Feedback 
How will my assignment be marked? 
Your assignment will   be   marked   by the Graphic   Design Team during face-to-face   presentation of   your   digital   (on Aula) and   physical coursework (in the studio)   submission.
How will I receive my grades and feedback? 
•             Provisional   marks will   be released   on Aula   Handin   once   internally   moderated.
•             Summative feedback will   be verbally   recorded at   presentation and   provided   alongside   your work   in the submission   portal   on Aula   Handin.
•             Provisional   marks and feedback will   be   made   available   to   you within   15   working   days   if you're   a      first or second year student, and   10 working days   if you're a final year student.   This   is   calculated   from the   module submission due date.
Provisional   marks will   be   released after internal   moderation   processes   in   keeping with   University Guidelines. This   means that   10% of all   marks will   be   reviewed   by someone   other than the   module   leader to ensure parity and accuracy of assessment.
On this   module you will   receive formative and summative feedback to   help and   ensure   your   learning.
Formative feedback is when you show work in   progress and   responses   to   key   milestones   within   the   module as a   preparation for the final summative assessment   point   when   you will   submit   your work and receive a grade.   Formative feedback happens every   time   you   discuss   with   either   your   peers   or   staff about your work. You will   have opportunities to change and   amend   your work   after   formative         feedback. You will   receive formative feedback from tutors   and student colleagues throughout the module   in tutorials, workshops, seminars and critique / review   sessions.
You are expected to document and reflect   on   feedback   as   an   aide-memoire for   developing   your work.   Use your sketchbook and   Design   Process   Document as   necessary.
All formative critique points are highlighted in the module schedule. 
Summative feedback is definitive, and you will   receive this at the end   of the   module   during   the assessment   period. Summative feedback   highlights   how your work   performed against the learning   outcomes   and   is accompanied   by a grade.
